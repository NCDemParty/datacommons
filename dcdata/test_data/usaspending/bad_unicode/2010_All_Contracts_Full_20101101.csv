She will convert the input signals at 1.27 Âµm and 1.57 Âµm to those at 579 nm and 634 nm, respectively, within a periodically-poled LiNbO3 wafer, pumped by a Nd:YAG laser at 1.064 Âµm or a 200-mW InGaAs laser at 980 nm. The anticipated results for Phase 1 include demonstrations of efficient frequency up-conversion from 1.27 Âµm and 1.57 Âµm to 579 nm and 634 nm, determination of fundamental limits to noise equivalent powers, performance of the proposed detection system after optimizations, a final design of an ultra-compact detection system after considering e.g. an intracavity configuration, and reports. Beginning/end (Phase 1): TRL 1/3. The anticipated results for Phase 2 include implementation and testing of the ultra-compact detection system, measurement and analysis of noise equivalent powers and photon sensitivities, expansion of detection wavelengths to 1-1.8 Âµm and 3-4 Âµm, feasibility analysis of single-photon sensitivity, design, implementation, and testing of a battery-powered, cell-phone-sized, and integrable detection system with single photon sensitivity being achieved, to be tested in space-based platforms, and reports.",N: Other than Local Government,N: Transaction does not use GFE/GFP,N: Other than City,NA,N: Other than County,N: Other than Inter Municipal,No,N: Other than Local Government Owned,X: NO,N: Other than Municipality,,N: Other than School District,N: No - Service where PBA is not used.,N: Other than Township,,N: Other than Tribal Government,,N: Other than Foreign Government,No,1,N: Other than Corporate Entity Not Tax Exempt,N: No,N: Other than Partnership Or Limited Liability Partnership,N: No,N: No,N: Other than Sole Propreitorship,N: Other than Small Agricultural Cooperative,N: No,N: Other than International Organization,X: Not Applicable(the field does not apply),,AR11: Aeronautics and Space Technology -- Basic Research (R&D),,D: Not a bundled requirement,N: Other than Community Development Corporation,,,"541712: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE PHYSICAL, ENGINEERING, AND LIFE SCIENCES (EXCEPT BIOTECHNOLOGY)",N: Other than Domestic Shelter,C: No Clauses Included,N: Other than Educational Institution,,No,,E: Not Required,,US: UNITED STATES,C: Not a manufactured end product,3210 N BAY HILL DR,,N: Other than Grants,,CENTER VALLEY,Y: Both (Contracts and Grants),N: Other than Airport Authority,PA: Pennsylvania,180348452,N: Other than Council of Governments,N: Other than Housing Authorities Public/Tribal,USA,N: Other than Interstate Entity,1079733020000,N: Other than Planning Commission,N: Other than Port Authority,15,N: Other than Transit Authority,,N: Other than Subchapter S Corporation,PA: Pennsylvania,N: Other than Limited Liability Corporation,N: Other than Foreign Owned and Located,US: UNITED STATES,180348452,,15,D: Full and Open Competition after exclusion of sources,f,,NP: Negotiated Proposal / Quote,SBA: Small Business Set-Aside -- Total,SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP,NONE: No Preference used,2,SR1,1,,N: Other than 1862 Land Grant College,N: Other than 1890 Land Grant College,,2,N: Other than 1994 Land Grant College,D: Commercial Item Procedures not used,,N: Other than Minority Institution,No,No,No,N: Other than Veterinary College,N: Other than Self-Certified Small Disadvantaged Business,N: Other than 8(a) Program Participant,N: Other than Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) Firm,4845475375,6108679794,S: Small Business,,0000000000000,2010,DING YUJIE J,80: National Aeronautics and Space Administration,A: Research and development,PA15: Pennsylvania 15,PA15: Pennsylvania 15,80,0122,"", ,c
